In the world of animal nutrition, maintaining the health, productivity, and well-being of livestock is a top priority.

Adelbert Vegyszerek, a trusted name in chemical manufacturing, proudly offers premium Feed Grade Sodium Bicarbonate—a versatile and essential solution for animal feed formulations.  
 The Importance of Feed Grade Sodium Bicarbonate  
Feed Grade Sodium Bicarbonate plays a vital role in animal husbandry. It is primarily used as a buffer to regulate and stabilize the pH levels in livestock diets, especially for ruminants like cattle. By neutralizing excessive acidity in the rumen, sodium bicarbonate supports optimal digestion, enhances nutrient absorption, and promotes healthy milk production in dairy cattle.  
Beyond ruminants, sodium bicarbonate also finds application in poultry diets, helping birds maintain acid-base balance, thereby improving eggshell quality and overall health. For swine, it aids in better feed conversion ratios and contributes to the well-being of the animals under various environmental conditions.
